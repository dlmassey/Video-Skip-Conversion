This is the folder that will be maintained the most.

Specifics on the file:

1. Use a separate directory to test these files until you are comfortable with their performance. Remove any file(s) that have the same name and target extension of what you're working with. 
2.  There are 2 types of files here: Directory and FileDrop
	a. Directory- Reads a directory and converts all file(s) (that match the extension) to the destination.
	b. Filedrop-Allows a drag and drop onto the program in order to convert that one file.
3.  The only exception to rule #2 would be the VideoRedo Project version 5 to version 2 for Kodi. Since both files use the same extension, I decided to add v2 to the end of the filename. I wasn't sure what else to do.
