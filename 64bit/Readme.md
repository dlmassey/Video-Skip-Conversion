This is the folder that will be maintained the most.

Specifics on the file:

1. Use a separate directory to test these files until you are comfortable with their performance. Remove any file(s) that have the same name and target extension of what you're working with. 
2.  There are 2 types of files here: Directory and FileDrop
	a. Directory- Reads a directory and converts all file(s) (that match the extension) to the destination.
	b. Filedrop-Allows a drag and drop onto the program in order to convert that one file.
3.  The only exception to rule #2 would be the VideoRedo Project version 5 to version 2 for Kodi. Since both files use the same extension, I decided to add v2 to the end of the filename. I wasn't sure what else to do. 
4. The EDL,Vrj,and Comskip files specification and descriptions are found on the Kodi and XBMC Wikis. I tested the Vrj and EDL files on several videos. From my experience, the cut function is unreliable in Kodi on EDL and Vrj files. The commercial skip and mute work great for me. I couldn't get bookmarks to work for EDL and Vrj files, but it could have been operator error, bad code, or bad output file.
Again, I used the Kodi Wiki to give me guidance on what the output file for Kodi should look like. I use Kodi Leia 18.6 on the Raspberry Pi 4 to test the Kodi files.

Feedback is greatly appreciated
