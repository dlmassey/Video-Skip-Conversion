# Video-Skip-Conversion
Create files that will convert between several video skip multimedia formats

The goal of this project is to share some files that allow someone to convert between different multimedia files that are used in video skipping and muting parts of a video. I've used Zoomplayer's Scene Cut Editor, Potplayer's Skip editor,and Kodi's EDL files to accomplish this and wanted some way to accomplish converting their files between each other and to other formats. I've looked around and couldn't find any software that could accomplish this. I know there is an audience that wants to skip and mute portions of video and audio in videos and movies and I want to share my code with everyone that accomplishes this. 


Disclaimer: Things to consider when using these programs:
1.  These are written during my spare time and this project will be maintained while my time and interest is there and while I have a goal of what I want to code.
2. These files are written on a Windows 10 64-bit computer in Python. My goal in the future is to find a way to make them 32-bit so more people can use them.
3. I'm focused on the Zoomplayer, Potplayer, and Kodi video skipping and muting files. I've looked at Comskip and VideoRedo files and I plan to look at others. I've looked at the BS Player bcf file, but don't know how to use it in the player.
4. Bookmarks and Scenemarks (depending on what player you use) is a lower priority.
5. Skipping and muting in time is a higher priority than skipping and muting in frames. For now, I don't understand timecodes and dropped frames, but I'm focusing mainly on skipping/muting in time.
6. When you are using these programs for the first time, set aside a directory to test them to make sure that they accomplish what the titles state that they do.
